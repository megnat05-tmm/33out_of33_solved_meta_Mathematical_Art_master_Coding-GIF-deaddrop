# Meta_Level_4_solved_my_33-33_master_Coding
Some samples of GIF's made, and metrics--for viewing of solution to 'Mathematical Art,' the level-4 Meta-Coding Puzzle.
Simply unzip (or unpack 7zip if needed--easily accessed) and view the GIF's, they range from a few seconds to about 45 seconds long.
What you will see, in effect, is the path-enumeration of plusses/intersections in a novel way. 

Thank you,
