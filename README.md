**EPDT Visual Series – GIF Deaddrop**

This repository contains a visual record of runs associated with a solution to the **“Mathematical Art” Level-4 Meta Coding Puzzle**.

Inside the archive are a series of animated GIFs.
Each GIF records the growth of a path-based system in which intersections (“plusses”) are detected and marked during the evolution of the walk.

The animations range from a few seconds to roughly 45 seconds.

What you are seeing, in effect, is a visual enumeration of **plus-sign intersections emerging from a discrete path process**.

Filenames typically encode metrics from the run, such as:

* seed values
* step counts
* total plus-sign events
* recurrence measurements (τ)

These images form a small atlas of the structures produced by the system.

To view:

1. Download the archive
2. Unzip (or unpack using 7-Zip)
3. Open the GIFs in any image viewer

No additional software is required.

Thank you for taking a look.
